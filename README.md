# Send-Email-
smtplb configuration for sending email with an attachment
Uses gmail and assumes you are sending from yourself to yourself
I had to log into my gmail account and accept "less secure apps" to send in this way.
You could break up the from and to variable into 2 variables and send them elsewhere that way.
